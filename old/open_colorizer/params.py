title = '''Personalities in Colors'''

thing = 'person'
things = 'people'

m1 = 'Agency'
m1_subtext = "Internal Locus of Control"
m1_spiel = '''
Does this person believe they can meaningfully affect outcomes — and act accordingly?
This is the master trait.

High-agency people:
Default to “what can I do?” not “why this won’t work”
Take responsibility even when it’s uncomfortable
Bend systems instead of submitting to them

Low-agency people:
Outsource causality (luck, society, bosses, systems)
Are emotionally reactive to constraints
May be intelligent, ethical, and “real” — and still inert

Why this survives the cut:
Agency predicts execution better than intelligence
It determines whether other virtues ever get deployed
You cannot build with low-agency people long-term
How to detect it quickly
Listen for verbs: “I decided”, “I tried”, “I changed” vs “they wouldn’t let me”
Ask about failures: do they own them or narrate excuses?'''

m2 = 'Horizon'
m2_subtext = 'Compounding Time and Orientation'
m2_spiel = '''
Distance and direction, combined in a vector that is Horizon.
Does this person think in loops or in lines?
This is subtle and rare.

High score:
Sacrifices short-term comfort for long-term positioning
Understands second-order effects
Builds things that grow when unattended

Low score:
Optimizes for immediacy (status, relief, validation)
Repeats cycles without learning
Thinks effort resets instead of accumulates

Why this survives:
This trait determines whether someone becomes an ally, a liability, or dead weight over time
Long-term thinkers synchronize naturally

How to detect it
Ask about decisions that only paid off years later
Listen for language like “positioning”, “optionality”, “trajectory”
Watch whether they respect patience or mock it'''

m3 = 'Vision'
m3_subtext = 'Quality of World Model'
m3_spiel = '''
How accurately does this person see reality — especially uncomfortable reality?
Rather than intelligence, it’s epistemic hygiene.

High score:
Changes their mind when evidence shifts
Separates signals from narratives
Can hold conflicting ideas without flinching

Low score:
Confuses moral preference with truth
Is fluent, confident, and wrong
Protects identity over accuracy

This is where your Thiel instincts land:
Optimist vs pessimist
Contrarian vs conformist
Those are expressions of this deeper trait.

Why it matters:
You cannot reason, plan, or compound with someone who lies to themselves
Bad world models infect everything downstream

How to detect it
Present a counterfactual that threatens their identity
Watch whether they explore or defend
Ask: “What’s something important you changed your mind about?”
